# `web/docs`

The `web/docs` directory features public facing — that is, non-classified information available to the general public — documentation about your application.

As a form of consistency, field test, and dogfeeding, the documentation page extends its layers from the  `web/common` and `web/ui` layers. For those reasons, it is encouraged that the same UI components, utilities and composables you would use in your application are also used within the documentation page.
