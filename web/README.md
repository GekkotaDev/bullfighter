# `web`

The `web` directory houses projects that are related to the web. These do not necessarily have a distinction between frontend and backend, and is up to the project's discretion whether to use Nuxt as a full stack framework or for the improved Developer Experience in a frontend only context, and that these relate directly to the web.

Additionally, it is also kept separate in the event that the project requires either a separate [backend](https://nestjs.com) [framework](https://laravel.com/) or that the client side apps are rewritten in another [framework](https://flutter.dev/). It is recommended in those cases to put them in distinctly separate directories, to make it clear and obvious that they are independent programs whose sum contributes to the complete app; additionally, this allows them to have independent tooling and build processes.
